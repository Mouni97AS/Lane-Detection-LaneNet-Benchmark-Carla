# Lane Detection-LaneNet
Tensorflow implementation of deep neural network for real time lane detection-LaneNet model.


LaneNet architecture consist of encoder-decoder network ENet that modified into two branched network, binary segmentation branch and instance segmentation embedding branch.
The main network architecture is as follows:
